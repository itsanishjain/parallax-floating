MY Prompts step by step:


1. Make a Parallax Floating Gallery using tailwind, Nextjs14 use framer motion for the animation
make a text at the center called Fancy and button at the center below the text called Donwload

see how this looks like so remember when I hover over this component it's images just nicely floats
`upload image as well`

2. ok this still not feels the same what i want is depth so some images should looks like they are far way in page and we need to create very nice illsusion that images are far and clos to us and when we hover it behaves in very cool way

3. OK please make images smaller add more depth to images add shadows and proper dark lighting as well

4. Ok now think you are a designer from app having 25 years of experience building products for billions of users you are sir jony ive to be exact now make this gallery experience state of art something unimaginable something unique that no one one have ever seen it before do it like like it's your life last works so you know what is it at stake people will remember you for this
